/**
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, ACE is a subsequence of ABCDE while AEC is not).

Example 1:


Input: S = rabbbit, T = rabbit
Output:&nbsp;3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate rabbit from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)
