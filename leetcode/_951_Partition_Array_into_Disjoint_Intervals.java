/**
Given an array A, partition it&nbsp;into two (contiguous) subarrays&nbsp;left&nbsp;and right&nbsp;so that:


	Every element in left&nbsp;is less than or equal to every element in right.
	left and right are non-empty.
	left&nbsp;has the smallest possible size.


Return the length of left after such a partitioning.&nbsp; It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: [5,0,3,8,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]



Example 2:


Input: [1,1,1,0,6,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]


&nbsp;


Note:


	2 &lt;= A.length&nbsp;&lt;= 30000
	0 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 10^6
	It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition A as described.
