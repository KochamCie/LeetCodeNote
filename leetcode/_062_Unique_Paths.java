A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked &#39;Start&#39; in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked &#39;Finish&#39; in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -&gt; Right -&gt; Down
2. Right -&gt; Down -&gt; Right
3. Down -&gt; Right -&gt; Right


Example 2:


Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
