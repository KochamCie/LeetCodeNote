/**
A rectangle is&nbsp;represented as a&nbsp;list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where&nbsp;(x1, y1)&nbsp;are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and (x2,&nbsp;y2)&nbsp;are the coordinates of its top-right corner.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive.&nbsp; To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether&nbsp;they overlap.

Example 1:


Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true


Example 2:


Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
Output: false


Notes:


	Both rectangles rec1 and rec2 are lists of 4 integers.
	All coordinates in rectangles will be between&nbsp;-10^9 and 10^9.
