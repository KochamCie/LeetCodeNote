/**
Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.


	push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
	pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
	top() -- Get the top element.
	empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.


Example:


MyStack stack = new MyStack();

stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);  
stack.top();   // returns 2
stack.pop();   // returns 2
stack.empty(); // returns false

Notes:


	You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
	Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
	You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
