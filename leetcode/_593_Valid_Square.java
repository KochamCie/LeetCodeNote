/**
Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, return whether the four points could construct a square.

The coordinate (x,y) of a point is represented by an integer array with two integers.

Example:

Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
Output: True



 Note: 

All the input integers are in the range [-10000, 10000].
A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
Input points have no order.
