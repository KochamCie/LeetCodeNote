/**
Given an array of citations sorted&nbsp;in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher&#39;s h-index.

According to the&nbsp;definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has index&nbsp;h&nbsp;if&nbsp;h&nbsp;of his/her&nbsp;N&nbsp;papers have&nbsp;at least&nbsp;h&nbsp;citations each, and the other&nbsp;N &minus; h&nbsp;papers have&nbsp;no more than&nbsp;h&nbsp;citations each.

Example:


Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
&nbsp;            Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
&nbsp;            two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

Note:

If there are several possible values for&nbsp;h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:


	This is a follow up problem to&nbsp;H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
	Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
