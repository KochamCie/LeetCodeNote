/**
Given a positive&nbsp;integer N, find and return the longest distance between two consecutive 1&#39;s in the binary representation of N.

If there aren&#39;t two consecutive 1&#39;s, return 0.

&nbsp;











Example 1:


Input: 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 
22 in binary is 0b10110.
In the binary representation of 22, there are three ones, and two consecutive pairs of 1&#39;s.
The first consecutive pair of 1&#39;s have distance 2.
The second consecutive pair of 1&#39;s have distance 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.



Example 2:


Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
5 in binary is 0b101.



Example 3:


Input: 6
Output: 1
Explanation: 
6 in binary is 0b110.



Example 4:


Input: 8
Output: 0
Explanation: 
8 in binary is 0b1000.
There aren&#39;t any consecutive pairs of 1&#39;s in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.
