/**
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked &#39;Start&#39; in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked &#39;Finish&#39; in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?



An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:


Input:
[
&nbsp; [0,0,0],
&nbsp; [0,1,0],
&nbsp; [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -&gt; Right -&gt; Down -&gt; Down
2. Down -&gt; Down -&gt; Right -&gt; Right
