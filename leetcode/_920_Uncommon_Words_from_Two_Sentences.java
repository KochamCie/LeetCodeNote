We are given two sentences A and B.&nbsp; (A sentence&nbsp;is a string of space separated words.&nbsp; Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is uncommon&nbsp;if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words.&nbsp;
