/**
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

Example 1:


Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 &times;&nbsp;3

Example 2:


Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 &times; 2 &times;&nbsp;2


Example 3:


Input: 14
Output: false 
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.


Note:


	1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
	Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range:&nbsp;[&minus;231,&nbsp; 231&nbsp;&minus; 1].
