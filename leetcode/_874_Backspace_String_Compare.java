/**
Given two&nbsp;strings&nbsp;S&nbsp;and T,&nbsp;return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.


Example 1:


Input: S = ab#c, T = ad#c
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become ac.



Example 2:


Input: S = ab##, T = c#d#
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become .



Example 3:


Input: S = a##c, T = #a#c
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become c.



Example 4:


Input: S = a#c, T = b
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes c while T becomes b.


Note:


	1 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 200
	1 &lt;= T.length &lt;= 200
	S&nbsp;and T only contain&nbsp;lowercase letters and &#39;#&#39; characters.


Follow up:


	Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?
