Given two integers A and B, return any string S such that:


	S has length A + B and contains exactly A &#39;a&#39; letters, and exactly B &#39;b&#39; letters;
	The substring&nbsp;&#39;aaa&#39;&nbsp;does not occur in S;
	The substring &#39;bbb&#39; does not occur in S.


&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: A = 1, B = 2
Output: abb
Explanation: abb, bab and bba are all correct answers.

Note:


	0 &lt;= A &lt;= 100
	0 &lt;= B &lt;= 100
	It is guaranteed such an S exists for the given A and B.
