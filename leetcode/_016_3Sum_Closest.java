/**
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums&nbsp;such that the sum is closest to&nbsp;target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:


Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
