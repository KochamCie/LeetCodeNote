/**
The&nbsp;Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted&nbsp;F(n)&nbsp;form a sequence, called the&nbsp;Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,


F(0) = 0,&nbsp; &nbsp;F(1)&nbsp;= 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N &gt; 1.


Given N, calculate F(N).

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.


Example 2:


Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.


Example 3:


Input: 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.


&nbsp;

Note:

0 &le; N &le; 30.
