/**
We define the Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of all its positive divisors except itself. 

Now, given an integer n, write a function that returns true when it is a perfect number and false when it is not.


Example:

Input: 28
Output: True
Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14



Note:
The input number n will not exceed 100,000,000. (1e8)
