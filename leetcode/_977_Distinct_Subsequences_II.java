/**
Given a string S, count the number of distinct, non-empty subsequences of S .

Since the result may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: abc
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, and abc.



Example 2:


Input: aba
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are a, b, ab, ba, aa and aba.



Example 3:


Input: aaa
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are a, aa and aaa.
