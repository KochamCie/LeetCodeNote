/**
A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

&nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp;

This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes N-1 hops.&nbsp; Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing N digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, output the answer&nbsp;modulo 10^9 + 7.

&nbsp;





Example 1:


Input: 1
Output: 10



Example 2:


Input: 2
Output: 20



Example 3:


Input: 3
Output: 46


&nbsp;

Note:


	1 &lt;= N &lt;= 5000
