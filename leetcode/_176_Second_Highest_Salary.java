Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.


+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+


For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.
