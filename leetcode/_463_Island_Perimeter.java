/**
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn&#39;t have lakes (water inside that isn&#39;t connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don&#39;t exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Example:


Input:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Output: 16

Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:
