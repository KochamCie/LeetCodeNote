/**
Let&#39;s say a positive integer is a&nbsp;superpalindrome&nbsp;if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.

Now, given two positive&nbsp;integers L and R (represented as strings), return the number of superpalindromes in the inclusive range [L, R].

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: L = 4, R = 1000
Output: 4
Explanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.

&nbsp;

Note:


	1 &lt;= len(L) &lt;= 18
	1 &lt;= len(R) &lt;= 18
	L and R are strings representing integers in the range [1, 10^18).
	int(L) &lt;= int(R)
