/**
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return&nbsp;the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Example :


Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.


Note:


	The size of the BST will be between 2 and&nbsp;100.
	The BST is always valid, each node&#39;s value is an integer, and each node&#39;s value is different.
