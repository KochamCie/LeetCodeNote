/**
Given a directed, acyclic graph of N nodes.&nbsp; Find all possible paths from node 0 to node N-1, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows:&nbsp; the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.&nbsp; graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.


Example:
Input: [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
Explanation: The graph looks like this:
0---&gt;1
|    |
v    v
2---&gt;3
There are two paths: 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 3 and 0 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3.


Note:


	The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range [2, 15].
	You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of nodes inside one path.
