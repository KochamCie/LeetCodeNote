/**
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:


Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation:&nbsp;There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
&nbsp;            To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:


Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation:&nbsp;There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
&nbsp;            To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
&nbsp;            also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.


Note:


	The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
	You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
