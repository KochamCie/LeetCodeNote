Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

Example 1:



Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 &times; 1 = 1.


Example 2:


Input: 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 &times;&nbsp;3 &times;&nbsp;4 = 36.

Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.
