/**
A string S of lowercase letters is given.&nbsp; Then, we may make any number of moves.

In each move, we&nbsp;choose one&nbsp;of the first K letters (starting from the left), remove it,&nbsp;and place it at the end of the string.

Return the lexicographically smallest string we could have after any number of moves.

&nbsp;


Example 1:


Input: S = cba, K = 1
Output: acb
Explanation: 
In the first move, we move the 1st character (c) to the end, obtaining the string bac.
In the second move, we move the 1st character (b) to the end, obtaining the final result acb.



Example 2:


Input: S = baaca, K = 3
Output: aaabc
Explanation: 
In the first move, we move the 1st character (b) to the end, obtaining the string aacab.
In the second move, we move the 3rd character (c) to the end, obtaining the final result aaabc.

Note:


	1 &lt;= K &lt;= S.length&nbsp;&lt;= 1000
	S&nbsp;consists of lowercase letters only.
