/**
On a&nbsp;N&nbsp;*&nbsp;N grid, we place some&nbsp;1 * 1 * 1&nbsp;cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value&nbsp;v = grid[i][j]&nbsp;represents a tower of&nbsp;v&nbsp;cubes placed on top of grid cell (i, j).

Now we view the&nbsp;projection&nbsp;of these cubes&nbsp;onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that&nbsp;maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane.&nbsp;

Here, we are viewing the shadow when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

Example 1:


Input: [[2]]
Output: 5



Example 2:


Input: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
Here are the three projections (shadows) of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.




Example 3:


Input: [[1,0],[0,2]]
Output: 8



Example 4:


Input: [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 14



Example 5:


Input: [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 21

Note:


	1 &lt;= grid.length = grid[0].length&nbsp;&lt;= 50
	0 &lt;= grid[i][j] &lt;= 50
