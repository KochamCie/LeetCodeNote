/**
You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists. 

We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a  or a  if b-a == d-c.

Example 1:

Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].




Note:

The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here.
1 k 
 -105 value of elements 5.
For Java users, please note that the input type has been changed to List&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;. And after you reset the code template, you'll see this point.
