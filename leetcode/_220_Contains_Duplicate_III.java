/**
Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.


Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true



Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true



Example 3:


Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false
