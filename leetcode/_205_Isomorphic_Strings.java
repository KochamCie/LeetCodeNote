/**
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:


Input: s = egg, t = add
Output: true


Example 2:


Input: s = foo, t = bar
Output: false

Example 3:


Input: s = paper, t = title
Output: true

Note:
You may assume both s&nbsp;and t&nbsp;have the same length.
