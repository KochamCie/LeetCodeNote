/**
In a N x N&nbsp;grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.&nbsp; These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \&nbsp;is represented as \\.)

Return the number of regions.

Example 1:


Input:
[
&nbsp;  /,
&nbsp; / 
]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:




Example 2:


Input:
[
&nbsp;  /,
&nbsp;   
]
Output: 1
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:




Example 3:


Input:
[
&nbsp; \\/,
&nbsp; /\\
]
Output: 4
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, \\/ refers to \/, and /\\ refers to /\.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:




Example 4:


Input:
[
&nbsp; /\\,
&nbsp; \\/
]
Output: 5
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, /\\ refers to /\, and \\/ refers to \/.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:




Example 5:


Input:
[
&nbsp; //,
&nbsp; / 
]
Output: 3
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:



&nbsp;

Note:


	1 &lt;= grid.length == grid[0].length &lt;= 30
	grid[i][j] is either &#39;/&#39;, &#39;\&#39;, or &#39; &#39;.
