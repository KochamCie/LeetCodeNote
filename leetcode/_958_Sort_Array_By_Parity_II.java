/**
Given an array A&nbsp;of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.


&nbsp;

Note:


	2 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 20000
	A.length % 2 == 0
	0 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 1000
