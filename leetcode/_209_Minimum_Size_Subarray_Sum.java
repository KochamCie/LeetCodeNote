/**
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum &ge; s. If there isn&#39;t one, return 0 instead.

Example:&nbsp;


Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).&nbsp;
