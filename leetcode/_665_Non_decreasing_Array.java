/**

Given an array with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.



We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i]  holds for every i (1 

Example 1:

Input: [4,2,3]
Output: True
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.



Example 2:

Input: [4,2,1]
Output: False
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.



Note:
The n belongs to [1, 10,000].
