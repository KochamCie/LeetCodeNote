/**
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray&nbsp;(containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:


Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation:&nbsp;[4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.


Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
