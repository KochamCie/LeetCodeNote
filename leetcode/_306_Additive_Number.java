/**
Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.

A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits &#39;0&#39;-&#39;9&#39;, write a function to determine if it&#39;s an additive number.

Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.

Example 1:


Input: 112358
Output: true 
Explanation: The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
&nbsp;            1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8


Example 2:


Input: 199100199
Output: true 
Explanation: The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.&nbsp;
&nbsp;            1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
