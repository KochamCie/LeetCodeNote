/**
Given an array A of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.&nbsp; Two permutations A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] != A2[i].

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: [1,17,8]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
[1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.


Example 2:


Input: [2,2,2]
Output: 1


&nbsp;

Note:


	1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 12
	0 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 1e9
