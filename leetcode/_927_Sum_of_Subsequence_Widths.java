/**
Given an array of integers A, consider all non-empty subsequences of A.

For any sequence S, let the&nbsp;width&nbsp;of S be the difference between the maximum and minimum element of S.

Return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of A.&nbsp;

As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.


&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: [2,1,3]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3], [2,1,3].
The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.
The sum of these widths is 6.

Note:


	1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 20000
	1 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 20000
