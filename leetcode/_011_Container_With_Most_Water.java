/**
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an&nbsp;, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note:&nbsp;You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

&nbsp;



The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain&nbsp;is 49. 

&nbsp;

Example:


Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
