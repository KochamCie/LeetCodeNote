/**
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = abcd and B = cdabcdab.

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (&ldquo;abcdabcdabcd&rdquo;), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times (abcdabcd).

Note:
The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
