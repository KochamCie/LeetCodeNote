/**
Given string S and a&nbsp;dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of S.


Example :
Input: 
S = abcde
words = [a, bb, acd, ace]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: a, acd, ace.


Note:


	All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.
	The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].
	The length of words will be in the range of&nbsp;[1, 5000].
	The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].
