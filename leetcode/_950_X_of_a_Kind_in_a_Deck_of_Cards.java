/**
In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return true if and only if you can choose&nbsp;X &gt;= 2 such that&nbsp;it is possible to split the entire deck&nbsp;into 1 or more groups of cards, where:


	Each group has exactly X cards.
	All the cards in each group have the same integer.


&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]



Example 2:


Input: [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.



Example 3:


Input: [1]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.



Example 4:


Input: [1,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1]



Example 5:


Input: [1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[2,2]







Note:


	1 &lt;= deck.length &lt;= 10000
	0 &lt;= deck[i] &lt;&nbsp;10000
