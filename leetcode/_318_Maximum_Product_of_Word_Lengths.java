/**
Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example 1:


Input: [abcw,baz,foo,bar,xtfn,abcdef]
Output: 16 
Explanation: The two words can be abcw, xtfn.

Example 2:


Input: [a,ab,abc,d,cd,bcd,abcd]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The two words can be ab, cd.

Example 3:


Input: [a,aa,aaa,aaaa]
Output: 0 
Explanation: No such pair of words.
