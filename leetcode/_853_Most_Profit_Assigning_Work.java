/**
We have jobs: difficulty[i]&nbsp;is the difficulty of the&nbsp;ith job, and&nbsp;profit[i]&nbsp;is the profit of the&nbsp;ith job.&nbsp;

Now we have some workers.&nbsp;worker[i]&nbsp;is the ability of the&nbsp;ith worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most&nbsp;worker[i].&nbsp;

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job&nbsp;can be completed multiple times.

For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3.&nbsp; If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.

What is the most profit we can make?

Example 1:


Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100 
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get profit of [20,20,30,30] seperately.

Notes:


	1 &lt;= difficulty.length = profit.length &lt;= 10000
	1 &lt;= worker.length &lt;= 10000
	difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i]&nbsp; are in range&nbsp;[1, 10^5]
