/**
Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of any rectangle formed from these points, with sides not necessarily parallel to the x and y axes.

If there isn&#39;t any rectangle, return 0.

&nbsp;

Example 1:




Input: [[1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: The minimum area rectangle occurs at [1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,1], with an area of 2.



Example 2:




Input: [[0,1],[2,1],[1,1],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: The minimum area rectangle occurs at [1,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,0], with an area of 1.



Example 3:




Input: [[0,3],[1,2],[3,1],[1,3],[2,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no possible rectangle to form from these points.



Example 4:




Input: [[3,1],[1,1],[0,1],[2,1],[3,3],[3,2],[0,2],[2,3]]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: The minimum area rectangle occurs at [2,1],[2,3],[3,3],[3,1], with an area of 2.

Note:


	1 &lt;= points.length &lt;= 50
	0 &lt;=&nbsp;points[i][0] &lt;=&nbsp;40000
	0 &lt;=&nbsp;points[i][1] &lt;=&nbsp;40000
	All points are distinct.
	Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
