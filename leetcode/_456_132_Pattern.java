/**

Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a subsequence ai, aj, ak such
that i j k and ai k j. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.

Note: n will be less than 15,000.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: False

Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.



Example 2:

Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]

Output: True

Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].



Example 3:

Input: [-1, 3, 2, 0]

Output: True

Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].
