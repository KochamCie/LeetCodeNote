The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n&times;n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens&#39; placement, where &#39;Q&#39; and &#39;.&#39; both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:


Input: 4
Output: [
 [.Q..,  // Solution 1
  ...Q,
  Q...,
  ..Q.],

 [..Q.,  // Solution 2
  Q...,
  ...Q,
  .Q..]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
