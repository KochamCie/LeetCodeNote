/**
In a given 2D binary array A, there are two islands.&nbsp; (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of&nbsp;1s not connected to any other 1s.)

Now, we may change 0s to 1s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1 island.

Return the smallest number of 0s that must be flipped.&nbsp; (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least 1.)

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 1



Example 2:


Input: [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2



Example 3:


Input: [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 1

&nbsp;



Note:


	1 &lt;= A.length =&nbsp;A[0].length &lt;= 100
	A[i][j] == 0 or A[i][j] == 1
