/**
Given two arrays A and B of equal size, the advantage of A with respect to B is the number of indices i&nbsp;for which A[i] &gt; B[i].

Return any permutation of A that maximizes its advantage with respect to B.

&nbsp;


Example 1:


Input: A = [2,7,11,15], B = [1,10,4,11]
Output: [2,11,7,15]



Example 2:


Input: A = [12,24,8,32], B = [13,25,32,11]
Output: [24,32,8,12]


&nbsp;

Note:


	1 &lt;= A.length = B.length &lt;= 10000
	0 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 10^9
	0 &lt;= B[i] &lt;= 10^9
