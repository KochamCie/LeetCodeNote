/**
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;palindrome when it&nbsp;reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:


Input: 121
Output: true


Example 2:


Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


Example 3:


Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


Follow up:

Coud you solve&nbsp;it without converting the integer to a string?
