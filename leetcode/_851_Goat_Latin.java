/**
A sentence S is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to Goat Latin&nbsp;(a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)

The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:


	If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append ma&nbsp;to the end of the word.
	For example, the word &#39;apple&#39; becomes &#39;applema&#39;.
	&nbsp;
	If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add ma.
	For example, the word goat&nbsp;becomes oatgma.
	&nbsp;
	Add one letter &#39;a&#39;&nbsp;to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
	For example,&nbsp;the first word gets a added to the end, the second word gets aa added to the end and so on.


Return the&nbsp;final sentence representing the conversion from S&nbsp;to Goat&nbsp;Latin.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: I speak Goat Latin
Output: Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa


Example 2:


Input: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
Output: heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa


&nbsp;

Notes:


	S contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces.&nbsp;Exactly one space between each word.
	1 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 150.
