/**
The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:


	123
	132
	213
	231
	312
	321


Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note:


	Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
	Given&nbsp;k&nbsp;will be between 1 and n! inclusive.


Example 1:


Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: 213


Example 2:


Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: 2314
