/**
There is&nbsp;a special square room with mirrors on each of the four&nbsp;walls.&nbsp; Except for the southwest&nbsp;corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered 0, 1, and 2.

The square room has walls of length p, and a laser ray from the southwest corner&nbsp;first meets the east wall at a distance q&nbsp;from the 0th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.&nbsp; (It is guaranteed that the ray will meet&nbsp;a receptor eventually.)

&nbsp;


Example 1:


Input: p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.




Note:


	1 &lt;= p &lt;= 1000
	0 &lt;= q &lt;= p
