/**
On a 2 dimensional grid with R rows and C columns, we start at (r0, c0) facing east.

Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the&nbsp;first row and column, and the south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.

Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid.&nbsp;

Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.)&nbsp;

Eventually, we reach all R * C spaces of the grid.

Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: R = 1, C = 4, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]




&nbsp;

Example 2:


Input: R = 5, C = 6, r0 = 1, c0 = 4
Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]

Note:


	1 &lt;= R &lt;= 100
	1 &lt;= C &lt;= 100
	0 &lt;= r0 &lt; R
	0 &lt;= c0 &lt; C
