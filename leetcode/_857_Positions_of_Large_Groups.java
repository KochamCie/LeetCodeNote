/**
In a string&nbsp;S&nbsp;of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like S = abbxxxxzyy has the groups a, bb, xxxx, z and&nbsp;yy.

Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.&nbsp; We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

&nbsp;

Example 1:


Input: abbxxxxzzy
Output: [[3,6]]
Explanation: xxxx is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.


Example 2:


Input: abc
Output: []
Explanation: We have a,b and c but no large group.


Example 3:


Input: abcdddeeeeaabbbcd
Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]

&nbsp;

Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;1 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 1000
