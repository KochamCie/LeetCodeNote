/**
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., &nbsp;[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]&nbsp;might become &nbsp;[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:


Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1


Example 2:


Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
