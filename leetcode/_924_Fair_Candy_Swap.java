/**
Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: A[i] is the size of the i-th bar of candy that Alice has, and B[j] is the size of the j-th bar of candy that Bob has.

Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total&nbsp;amount of candy.&nbsp; (The total amount of candy&nbsp;a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy&nbsp;bars they have.)

Return an integer array ans&nbsp;where ans[0] is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange, and ans[1] is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.

If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.&nbsp; It is guaranteed an answer exists.

&nbsp;


Example 1:


Input: A = [1,1], B = [2,2]
Output: [1,2]



Example 2:


Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3]
Output: [1,2]



Example 3:


Input: A = [2], B = [1,3]
Output: [2,3]



Example 4:


Input: A = [1,2,5], B = [2,4]
Output: [5,4]


&nbsp;

Note:


	1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 10000
	1 &lt;= B.length &lt;= 10000
	1 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 100000
	1 &lt;= B[i] &lt;= 100000
	It is guaranteed that Alice and Bob have different total amounts of&nbsp;candy.
	It is guaranteed there exists an&nbsp;answer.
