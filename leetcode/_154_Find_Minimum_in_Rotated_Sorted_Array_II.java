/**
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., &nbsp;[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]&nbsp;might become &nbsp;[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:


Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1

Example 2:


Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0

Note:


	This is a follow up problem to&nbsp;Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
	Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
