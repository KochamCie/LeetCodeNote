/**
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where&nbsp;x&nbsp;is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type&nbsp;is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result&nbsp;is returned.

Example 1:


Input: 4
Output: 2


Example 2:


Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
&nbsp;            the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
